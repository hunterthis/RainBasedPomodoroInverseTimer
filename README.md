# ReversePomodoro
Portfolio Project Proposal – Rain Based Pomodoro Inverse Timer

Introduction:
Most pomodoro timers work like a regular clock. Set the time, count down till 0 and then play a tone to 
communicate that the time is up. There are two issues here. 
1) The user is startled by the timer ending
2) The user is distracted by the timer graphics counting down 

Solution:
This website will create a pomodoro timer that will play rain sound during the active sequence and stop 
playing the rain sound during the break sequence. The user will be notified by the lack of sound rather 
than the presence of sound. The goal is to decrease distractions and increase engagement in tasks 
performed.

Project requirements:
GitHub for source control, GitHub issues for work items and bugs
JavaScript as framework using libraries for playing sounds
Pomodoro API (github.com/jordanch/pomodoro)
Features:
Pomodoro Timer
Ambient Rain Sounds
Volume Control
